# Git Automation Rules
- When the user asks to "push changes" or "commit and push", automatically:
  1. Check git status
  2. Stage all changes (git add .)
  3. Commit with a descriptive message based on the changes
  4. Push to the remote repository
- Always ask for confirmation before pushing if there are uncommitted changes
- Generate meaningful commit messages based on file changes
- If the user says "push changes", "commit and push", or similar, execute the full git workflow automatically
