# Ideal Client Profile

## Who I Help
Established experts (coaches, consultants, authors, speakers) who want to build **Tesla brands** - quality + innovation at accessible-premium pricing.

They're good at what they do but stuck below $20K/month. They have unique knowledge but aren't fully tapping their earning potential.

## The Tesla Brand Filter
My best clients share this philosophy:

**They DON'T want to be Ferrari brands:**
- Not interested in ultra-premium status pricing ($25K+ offers)
- Not trying to be exclusive for exclusivity's sake
- Don't want to serve only the wealthy elite

**They DON'T want to be Ford brands:**
- Not interested in race-to-bottom pricing
- Don't want to scale through volume alone
- Refuse to sacrifice quality for accessibility

**They WANT to be Tesla brands:**
- Great form AND great function
- Premium quality at accessible prices
- Innovation-led, not status-led
- Serve more people without becoming commoditized

## Their Core Struggles
- Positioning themselves clearly in the market
- Creating offers that convert without feeling salesy
- Generating leads consistently
- Explaining what makes them different (not Ferrari, not Ford)
- Using digital marketing and AI effectively without burnout

## The Transitions They're In
My best clients are usually in one of these transitions:

1. **New Positioning** - Pivoting to a different niche or message
2. **New Offer** - Building or restructuring what they sell
3. **Passive → Active Marketing** - Moving from hope to intentional content/outreach/paid
4. **No AI → Smart AI** - Going from ignoring AI to using it for more sales in less time

## Who I Don't Work With
- **Ferrari wannabes** - People who just want to charge more without delivering more value
- **Ford racers** - People who want volume at all costs, willing to sacrifice quality
- **Shiny object chasers** - People who won't finish one thing before starting the next
- **"Do it for me" without engagement** - People who want results without participation

## Dream Client Example
An expert with real skills and 3+ years of experience. They've helped clients get results but their marketing doesn't reflect their quality. They're charging $3-8K for their offers when they could be at $8-15K with better positioning. They want to grow without becoming someone they're not. They value quality, clarity, and doing things right - not hacks or shortcuts.
