# NerdDigital Visual Brand Guidelines

## The Tesla Aesthetic

Your brand philosophy: **Form AND function. Quality at accessible-premium. Innovation-led.**

Visually, this means:
- **Clean, not cluttered** - generous whitespace, breathing room
- **Modern, not trendy** - timeless choices that won't look dated in 2 years
- **Professional, not corporate** - approachable but polished
- **Confident, not loud** - let the work speak, don't scream for attention

### What Tesla Looks Like vs. Ferrari vs. Ford

| Element | Ford (Avoid) | Ferrari (Avoid) | Tesla (Target) |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Colors | Dull, generic blues/grays | Gold, black, flashy gradients | Clean whites, bold accents, modern darks |
| Typography | Basic system fonts, cluttered | Ornate, luxury serifs | Clean sans-serif, confident hierarchy |
| Imagery | Stock photos, generic | Glamour shots, exclusivity | Real people, authentic, high-quality |
| Layout | Cramped, busy, everything competing | Dramatic, lots of empty space for "luxury" | Balanced, purposeful whitespace |
| CTAs | Aggressive, "BUY NOW" energy | Subtle, almost hidden | Clear, confident, single action |

## Color Palette

### Primary Colors

| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| **White** | `#FFFFFF` | Primary background |
| **Near Black** | `#1A1A1A` | Headlines, primary text |
| **NerdDigital Green** | `#41B649` | CTAs, accents, highlights |

### Secondary Colors

| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| **Cool Gray** | `#F5F7FA` | Section backgrounds, cards |
| **Slate** | `#64748B` | Body text, secondary info |
| **Deep Navy** | `#0F172A` | Footer, dark sections |

### Accent (Use Sparingly)

| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| **Electric Blue** | `#3B82F6` | Links, secondary accents |

### Colors to AVOID

- **Hot pink/magenta** - Not in our palette. The Trust Gap ebook cover breaks brand.
- **Gold/bronze** - Too "Ferrari," signals luxury exclusivity
- **Bright red** - Too aggressive, not our energy
- **Multiple competing accents** - Pick ONE accent per asset

## Typography

### Font Stack

| Use | Font | Weight | Notes |
|-----|------|--------|-------|
| **Headlines** | Rubik | 600-700 | Clean, modern, slightly rounded |
| **Body** | Open Sans | 400-600 | Readable, professional |
| **Accent/Code** | JetBrains Mono | 400 | For technical/nerdy moments |

### Hierarchy Rules

1. **One headline per section** - Don't compete with yourself
2. **Size contrast matters** - Headlines should be noticeably larger (1.5x+ body)
3. **Don't mix too many weights** - Regular + Bold is enough
4. **Left-align body text** - Centered is for short headlines only

## Imagery Style

### Photography

- **Real people** - Not glossy stock photos
- **Professional but approachable** - Headshots should look like someone you'd grab coffee with
- **Good lighting** - Natural or clean studio, not over-processed
- **Consistent treatment** - All headshots should have similar cropping/style

### Graphics & Illustrations

- **Minimal** - Simple shapes, clean lines
- **Purposeful** - Every graphic should communicate something, not just decorate
- **Consistent style** - Don't mix illustrated icons with 3D renders with stock graphics

### Ebook Covers / Lead Magnets

- **Use brand colors** - White/dark background with green accents
- **Clean typography** - Title should be readable at thumbnail size
- **Avoid busy backgrounds** - Solid colors or subtle gradients only
- **Consistent template** - All ebooks should look like they're from the same family

---

## Do's and Don'ts

### DO

- Use generous whitespace
- Stick to 2-3 colors max per asset
- Make CTAs clearly visible (green buttons)
- Keep layouts clean and scannable
- Use real testimonials with real photos
- Maintain consistent spacing/padding

### DON'T

- Use colors outside the palette (looking at you, pink ebook)
- Cram too much into one design
- Use different styles for each asset
- Mix multiple accent colors in one piece
- Use generic stock photography
- Add gradients/effects just because you can

## Quick Reference

**When in doubt:**

1. White background + dark text + green accent
2. Rubik for headlines, Open Sans for body
3. One CTA per section, make it green
4. More whitespace than you think you need
5. If it feels "loud," tone it down

**The Tesla test:** Would this look at home on tesla.com? Clean, confident, modern, innovative—but not flashy or exclusive.

## Brand Audit (January 2025)

### What's Working (Tesla Identity)

| Asset | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| LinkedIn banner | Good | Clean, white bg, green accent, client headshots |
| New website (Vercel) | Good | This is the target. Mint Trust Gap ebook, clean layout |
| Canvas download page | Good | Consistent green buttons, white bg, professional |

### What's Broken (Kill These)

| Asset | Problem | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| **coachingleadsroadmap** | Hot pink buttons, dark bg, completely different brand | Rebuild with white bg + green buttons |
| **Instagram thumbnails** | Chaos. Pink, blue, black, different styles per video | Create ONE template, reshoot/redesign all |
| **Trust Gap ebook (pink)** | Clashes with everything, not Tesla | Use the mint/green version from new site |
| **Accelerate page** | Dark header mixing with white, inconsistent photo treatment | Simplify to match new site style |
| **Current nerddigital.com** | Has the pink Trust Gap, otherwise okay | Replace ebook image, minor cleanup |

### The Core Problem

You've been building two brands:
1. **Tesla** - White, clean, green accents, confident, premium-accessible
2. **Aggressive Internet Marketer** - Dark, hot pink, "BUY NOW" energy, scarcity tactics

The pink needs to die. Every time you use hot pink/magenta, you're signaling "I'm like every other marketer" instead of "I'm the Tesla option."

## Action Items

### Priority 1: Kill the Pink (This Week)

1. **Replace Trust Gap ebook everywhere** - Use the mint/green version from the Vercel site
2. **Rebuild coachingleadsroadmap page** - White bg, green CTAs, same style as canvas page
3. **Update current nerddigital.com** - Swap pink ebook for green version

### Priority 2: Instagram Consistency (Next 2 Weeks)

1. **Create ONE video thumbnail template:**
   - White or dark navy background (pick one, stick to it)
   - Green accent for text highlights
   - Rubik font for titles
   - Your face in consistent position/size
   - Same frame/border treatment on every single one

2. **Reshoot or redesign existing thumbnails** - Yes, all of them. The inconsistency is hurting you.

### Priority 3: Landing Page Unification

1. **Accelerate page** - Simplify to match new website style
2. **Any other landing pages** - Audit against this guide, fix inconsistencies

### Template Recommendations

Create these in Canva/Figma and LOCK THEM:
- Instagram/Reel thumbnail template (ONE design)
- LinkedIn carousel template (ONE design)
- Ebook cover template (green/mint version)
- Landing page section blocks (reusable)

The goal: Someone scrolling should recognize "that's NerdDigital" instantly, whether they're on Instagram, LinkedIn, your website, or a landing page.

## The NerdDigital Look (Reference)

When creating any new asset, reference these:
- **LinkedIn banner** - The energy, layout, and color usage
- **New Vercel website** - The overall feel and Trust Gap ebook design
- **Canvas download page** - Clean lead magnet presentation

When in doubt: White background, green accent, Rubik headlines, lots of breathing room. If it feels "loud" or "salesy," tone it down.
