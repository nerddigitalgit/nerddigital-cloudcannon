## Positioning Evolution (The Thinking Journey)

| Iteration | Idea | Why We Moved On |
|-----------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | "Innovation Consulting" | Too generic, everyone says it |
| 2 | "Integrates MR, UX, Strategy" | Description, not a category |
| 3 | "Human Side of Innovation" | True but soft, not budget-able |
| 4 | **"GTM Validation"** | Sharp, ownable, tied to case studies ✓ |

**Final positioning:** GTM Validation — Go-To-Market Validation

**Why it works:**
- Every case study answers: "Before we commit millions, will this work?"
- Sharp and specific (not vague consulting language)
- Ownable (no one else is claiming this term)
- Budget-able ("We need GTM Validation before Q3 launch")
- Cross-functional (speaks to Product, Marketing, Research, Strategy)

---

## Hero Section Options

### Option 1: Problem-Led
> "Innovation doesn't fail because of bad ideas. It fails because your teams won't talk to each other."

### Option 2: GTM Validation (Recommended)
> "Validate before you build. Launch with proof, not hope."

### Option 3: Authority-Led
> "Forbes-featured innovation research. 20+ years with Fortune 500."

---

## Homepage Structure

1. Hero — GTM Validation positioning
2. Logo Bar — Southwest, Marriott, Frito-Lay, Mozilla, NASA

6. About — Brianna's credibility, Forbes, endorsements

8. Process — Simple 3-step engagement

---

## CMS Differentiation

| Premium | Full control — create pages, sections, change layouts, full independence |

## Cross-Functional Context (Fortune 500 GTM)

Departments typically involved in GTM:
- Product Management
- Product Marketing
- Consumer Insights / Market Research
- UX / Design
- R&D / Innovation
- Brand / Marketing
- Strategy

**Common internal language:**
- Front-End Innovation (FEI)
- Stage-Gate
- New Product Development (NPD)
- Concept Testing
- BASES Testing
- Innovation Pipeline
- Commercialization
- Launch Readiness

**The hidden problem:** These teams often don't talk to each other. Brianna is the bridge. But don't sell "collaboration" — sell GTM Validation and deliver alignment.

---

## Continuity Upsell (After Website)

After 45-60 days, once the site is live:

**"Content + Pipeline Retainer"**
- 4-8 video scripts/month
- Posting + engagement strategy
- Monthly strategy call
- Performance tracking

**Monthly:** $2,500 - $3,500/month
**Performance kicker:** $2,500 per qualified lead OR 5% of new client revenue

## Sales Call Prep Notes

**Discovery already done:**

**Presentation flow:**
1. Acknowledge the pain
2. "You don't accept less than excellent"
3. Implications of staying stuck
4. Transformation goals (from → to)
5. Walk through GTM Validation thinking journey
6. Show 3 hero options, recommend Option 2
7. Homepage structure
8. Book page vision
9. Three packages (no prices)
10. "Which feels right?"

## Open Questions / To Revisit

- What's her budget tolerance? (Unknown — Standard at ~$7,500 is safe anchor)
- Continuity pricing — finalize before call?
