## SLIDE 1: Title

**Sylver Consulting**
Website Vision & Strategy

*Prepared by Marcio Santos | NerdDigital*

**Speaker Notes:**
> "Brianna, I've been thinking about your website since we last spoke. I wanted to show you what I see — not just a redesign, but a repositioning. This is the vision I have for Sylver Consulting online."

---

## SLIDE 2: The Pain

**Where You Are Right Now**

- 8 months waiting for a book page that still isn't live
- A homepage that hasn't been updated in a decade
- A static site that requires a developer for every change
- Ideas and updates stuck in your head instead of on your site

**Speaker Notes:**
> "I know this has been frustrating. You've been waiting 8 months just to get a book page up. Your homepage hasn't been touched in years. And every time you want to update something, you're dependent on someone else's timeline. That's not how it should work."

---

## SLIDE 3: The Standard You Hold

**You don't accept less than excellent.**

Not in your work.
Not in how you run your company.
Not in how you serve your clients.

Why accept less from your website?

**Speaker Notes:**
> "Here's what I know about you, Brianna. You don't cut corners. Your clients get your best thinking, your best frameworks, your best work. Sylver Consulting has a standard — and right now, your website isn't meeting it. That's not a criticism. That's an opportunity."

---

## SLIDE 4: What You're Missing

**The Implications of Staying Stuck**

Right now, you could be:

- Updating your website in minutes, not months
- Featuring client logos that build instant credibility
- Showcasing case studies that do the selling for you
- Attracting the right clients — Fortune 500 innovation leaders
- Standing out in 10 seconds with a sharp, clear message
- Sharing your thinking, your frameworks, your book — on your terms

Instead, you're waiting. And the world keeps moving.

**Speaker Notes:**
> "Let me be direct about what this is costing you. Every month that goes by, you're missing opportunities. People land on your site, and they don't immediately understand what makes Sylver different. Your Forbes-featured book isn't working as a lead generation tool. Your case studies — Southwest, Marriott, Frito-Lay — aren't front and center. You've built something incredible. Your website should reflect that."

---

## SLIDE 5: The Transformation

**Our Goals for Your Website**

| From | To |
|------|-----|
| Decade-old homepage | Fresh, current, updated |
| 8-month wait times | Instant updates, full control |
| Static site jail | Editable, customizable CMS |
| Fuzzy positioning | Sharp, categorical clarity |
| Buried case studies | Proof that sells for you |
| Book as afterthought | Book as lead generation engine |

**Speaker Notes:**
> "Here's what I want to accomplish for you. Take you from a decade-old homepage to something fresh. From 8-month wait times to instant control. From static site jail to a CMS you can edit yourself. From fuzzy positioning to sharp, categorical clarity. From buried case studies to proof that does the selling. And from your book being an afterthought to your book being a lead generation engine."

---

## SLIDE 6: The Thinking Journey

**How I Landed on Your Positioning**

I didn't just look at your website. I studied your case studies, your methodology pages, your book, your LinkedIn content. Here's the thinking process:

**Speaker Notes:**
> "I want to walk you through how I arrived at the positioning I'm going to recommend. I didn't just skim your site. I went deep — your case studies, your methodologies, your book, everything. And I went through several iterations of thinking before I landed on something that felt right."

---

## SLIDE 7: Iteration 1 — The Starting Point

**First thought: "Innovation Consulting"**

But that's what everyone says. McKinsey says it. Accenture says it. Every boutique firm says it.

It's accurate but not ownable.

❌ Too generic. No differentiation.

**Speaker Notes:**
> "My first instinct was 'innovation consulting.' But that's a crowded space. Everyone claims innovation. It doesn't set you apart."

---

## SLIDE 8: Iteration 2 — The Intersection

**Second thought: "We integrate Market Research, UX, and Strategy"**

This is true — it's your Venn diagram, your differentiator.

But it's a description, not a category. No one budgets for "integration of three disciplines."

❌ Accurate but not ownable.

**Speaker Notes:**
> "Then I looked at your Venn diagram — the intersection of market research, UX, and strategy. That's real. That's different. But it's a description, not a category. A VP of Innovation doesn't say 'We need to budget for integrating three disciplines.' It doesn't land as a thing they buy."

---

## SLIDE 9: Iteration 3 — The Human Side

**Third thought: "The Human Side of Innovation"**

Your book is about leading through uncertainty. The emotional, human dynamics.

This is true to your work. But it's soft. Hard to make a budget line item.

❌ True but not sharp enough.

**Speaker Notes:**
> "Then I thought about your book — 'Leading Through Free Fall.' It's about the human side of innovation. The emotions, the resistance, the trust-building. That's powerful. But 'human side of innovation' is soft. It's hard to sell. It doesn't have teeth."

---

## SLIDE 10: Iteration 4 — The Breakthrough

**Final landing: **

I looked at every case study. And I saw a pattern:

- Frito-Lay: "Should we enter salty-sweet?" → Yes. Broke BASES scores.
- Southwest: "How should we reposition?" → "Start with Heart." 8 awards.
- Marriott: "What mobile features should we build?" → Mobile Key. "Most Innovative Company."
- Air Freshener: "Will this product win?" → Highest BASES score in company history.

Every project answers one question:
**"Before we commit millions, will this work?"**

That's not research. That's not strategy. 

## SLIDE 11: 

That's **GTM Validation.**

✅ Sharp. Ownable. Budget-able.

**Speaker Notes:**
> "Then I went through your case studies one by one. Frito-Lay, Southwest, Marriott, the air freshener client. And I saw the pattern. Every single project answers the same question: 'Before we commit millions, will this work?' That's not generic research. That's not strategy consulting. That's something specific. I'm calling it GTM Validation — Go-To-Market Validation. It's the proof you need before you launch. And nobody else is owning that term."

---

## SLIDE 12: Why GTM Validation Works

**This is your category to own.**

| Why It Works | |
|--------------|---|
| **Sharp** | Not "innovation consulting" — a specific thing |
| **Ownable** | No one else is claiming this term |
| **Budget-able** | "We need GTM Validation before Q3 launch" |
| **True** | Every case study proves it |
| **Cross-functional** | Speaks to Product, Marketing, Research, Strategy |

**Speaker Notes:**
> "Here's why I think this works. It's sharp — not vague 'innovation consulting.' It's ownable — who else is claiming GTM Validation? It's budget-able — a VP can say 'We need GTM Validation before we commit.' It's true — your case studies prove it. And it's cross-functional — it speaks to Product, Marketing, Research, and Strategy teams. That's rare."

---

## SLIDE 13: The Cross-Functional Reality

**Who's involved in GTM decisions at Fortune 500?**

| Department | Their Pain |
|------------|-----------|
| **Product Management** | "Will this feature win?" |
| **Product Marketing** | "How do we position this?" |
| **Consumer Insights** | "What do customers actually want?" |
| **UX / Design** | "Are we building the right thing?" |
| **Innovation / R&D** | "Which concepts should we pursue?" |
| **Brand / Marketing** | "How do we stand out?" |

These teams often don't talk to each other.
**You're the bridge.**

**Speaker Notes:**
> "Here's the reality inside Fortune 500 companies. GTM decisions involve Product, Marketing, Research, UX, Innovation, Brand — and these teams often speak different languages. Research writes a 50-page deck. Product skims it and builds what they were going to build anyway. Marketing ignores both. That's why products fail. You sit at the intersection. You get these teams aligned. That's your superpower — even if you don't sell it that way."

---

## SLIDE 14: Hero Option 1 — Problem-Led

**"Innovation doesn't fail because of bad ideas.**
**It fails because your teams won't talk to each other."**

We sit at the intersection of market research, UX, and strategy — so your insights actually turn into action.

*Trusted by Southwest Airlines, Marriott, Frito-Lay, Mozilla, NASA.*

**Speaker Notes:**
> "Here's the first hero option. It leads with the problem — the silo problem. 'Innovation doesn't fail because of bad ideas. It fails because your teams won't talk to each other.' It's provocative. It makes people stop and think. And then it positions you as the bridge."

---

## SLIDE 15: Hero Option 2 — GTM Validation

**"Validate before you build.**
**Launch with proof, not hope."**

GTM Validation for enterprise product launches and brand moves.
Know what will win — before you commit.

*Trusted by Southwest Airlines, Marriott, Frito-Lay, Mozilla, NASA.*

**Speaker Notes:**
> "Here's the second option — and my recommendation. 'Validate before you build. Launch with proof, not hope.' It's direct. It positions you in the GTM Validation category. It speaks to the pain of launching products that fail. And it promises certainty before commitment."

---

## SLIDE 16: Hero Option 3 — Authority-Led

**"Forbes-featured innovation research.**
**20+ years with Fortune 500."**

Brianna Sylver helps enterprise teams fill innovation pipelines, align growth strategies, and lead through uncertainty.

*Trusted by Southwest Airlines, Marriott, Frito-Lay, Mozilla, NASA.*

**Speaker Notes:**
> "The third option leads with authority. Forbes feature, 20+ years, Fortune 500 clients. This works for people who already know they need this type of help and just want to vet credentials. It's less compelling for cold traffic, but strong for referrals."

---

## SLIDE 17: My Recommendation

**I'd go with Option 2: GTM Validation.**

Here's why:

- It's **sharp** — not generic consulting language
- It's **ownable** — you can be THE GTM Validation firm
- It's **tied to your proof** — every case study backs it up
- It **speaks to buyers** — Product, Marketing, Innovation all understand it
- It **differentiates** — no one else is saying this

**Speaker Notes:**
> "If it were me, I'd go with Option 2. GTM Validation. It's the sharpest positioning. It's ownable — you can be the GTM Validation firm. Every case study proves it. And it speaks directly to the people who hire you. The other options are valid, but this one has the most teeth."

---

## SLIDE 18: Homepage Structure

**The Full Page Flow**

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| 1. **Hero** | GTM Validation positioning — sharp, clear, immediate |
| 2. **Logo Bar** | Southwest, Marriott, Frito-Lay, Mozilla, NASA — instant credibility |
| 3. **Problem** | "Innovation fails when teams can't align" |
| 4. **Solution** | Your approach — integrating MR, UX, Strategy |
| 5. **Proof** | Case studies with outcomes (BASES scores, awards, launches) |
| 6. **About** | Brianna's credibility — Forbes, endorsements, 20+ years |
| 7. **Book** | "Leading Through Free Fall" — with lead capture |
| 8. **Process** | Simple 3-step engagement flow |
| 9. **CTA** | "Let's Talk" — clear next step |

**Speaker Notes:**
> "Here's how the full homepage would flow. Hero with the GTM Validation message. Immediately followed by client logos — instant credibility. Then we agitate the problem, present your solution, show proof with case studies, introduce you as the expert, feature your book as a lead magnet, show a simple process, and end with a clear call to action. Every section builds on the last."
