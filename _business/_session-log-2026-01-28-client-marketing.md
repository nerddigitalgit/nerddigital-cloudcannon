## Topic: Client Marketing & Proposals

---

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Client Call Coaching (Email Course Client)
- Discussed approach for upsell call - key question: is she lead-constrained or capacity-constrained?
- Identified 4 potential ongoing services: email marketing, social content, lead qualification system, webinar avatar formatting
- Strategy: diagnose first, don't pitch all 4 options - pick 1-2 based on what she says

### 2. Sylver Consulting - Follow-Up Response
- Brianna sent due diligence questions (developer portfolio, tech platform, ongoing costs)
- Good sign: she DM'd another client who gave positive testimonial
- Drafted response: honest about it being just you, offered free mockup, welcomed her designer to collaborate on visual polish
- Tech details: CloudCanon ($49/month after year 1), GoHighLevel ($49-97/month after year 1), both free year 1

### 3. SEO Proposal - Baby Skincare E-Commerce
- Small e-commerce brand selling skincare for Black/brown babies
- Founder has clinical background - strong story angle
- Structured two-tier one-time offer (no retainer):
  - **Package 1:** SEO Foundation - $1,700 (deep audit + implementation)
  - **Package 2:** SEO Foundation + Content Strategy - $2,400 (adds 25-30 keywords, 10-15 topics, free email course outline)
- Anchored against $15K retainer she didn't want ($2,500/mo x 6 months)
- Your margin: ~$705-1,010 (41-42%)

### 4. LinkedIn Content - Tesla Brand Post
- Revised post to align with email course (Lamborghini/Toyota/Tesla instead of Ferrari/Ford/Tesla)
- Reframed hook from car analogy to what people actually say: "serve the rich," "solve rich people problems"
- Clarified audience (coaches/consultants under $20K/month) and problem (stuck because they think they have to choose exclusive vs. cheap)

---

## Key Decisions Made

- **Sylver:** Position yourself as strategist who executes, not traditional dev shop. Free mockup as risk reducer. Open to her designer collaborating on visual polish.
- **SEO client:** Two packages, one-time fee, no retainer. Anchor high ($15K) then present $1,700 and $2,400 options.
- **Tesla brand post:** Use Lamborghini/Toyota/Tesla framework, speak to real advice people hear ("serve the rich")

## TODO for Next Session

- [ ] Finish social content for NerdDigital
- [ ] Website rebuild with new design system

---

## Notes

- Expert Conversion Code emails (Days 3, 4, 5) still need review and tightening from previous session
- Sylver proposal: Standard package ($7.5-8.5K) is the likely anchor if she moves forward after mockup
