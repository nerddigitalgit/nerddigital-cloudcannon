## THE PROBLEM

You're great at what you do.

But your marketing doesn't show it.

You've tried posting more. Running ads. Launching new offers.
Nothing sticks.

**The real issue?**
You're using tactics built for mass-market businesses — not for experts like you.

---

## WHO THIS IS FOR

This call is for domain experts — coaches, consultants, authors, speakers — who:

- Have real expertise and proven results with clients
- Are stuck below $20K/month despite being good at what they do
- Want to grow without becoming someone they're not
- Are tired of marketing that feels salesy or generic

**Not a fit if:**
- You're just getting started with no track record
- You want someone to "do it all" without your involvement
- You're looking for hacks or shortcuts

---

- Fresh eyes on your current marketing
- Honest feedback on what's working and what's not
- A simple recommendation for your next move
- Access to our private community

## FAQ SECTION

**Will you try to sell me something?**
Maybe. If we think we can help and you ask, we'll share how we work. But the call isn't a pitch — it's genuinely about giving you clarity on how to grow.

**What if my marketing is a mess?**
Good. That's what we're here for. Sometimes a mess just needs to be simplified, not rebuilt. We'll help you see what to keep and what to cut.

**What if I've tried everything?**
Then you have data about what doesn't work — that's valuable. We'll help you see patterns you might have missed.

**How quickly will I see results?**
Depends on what we recommend. Some things improve fast, others take time. We'll be honest about realistic timelines.

**What if I'm not at $250K+ yet?**
The call works best with real numbers to review. If you're under that but have consistent revenue and marketing data, we can still help. Our private community might be a better starting point.
