5 posts ready to schedule. One per pillar.

## POST 1 - FOCUS (Monday)
**Pillar:** FOCUS - "Finish before you chase"

The biggest lie in online business: "Do more."

One more course. One more funnel. One more strategy.

But here's what I've seen after helping experts hit $20K+ months:

The ones who win aren't doing more.

They're finishing what they already started.

Your half-built funnel is costing you more than no funnel at all.

What's the one thing you started but never finished?

## POST 2 - STORY & CATEGORY (Tuesday)
**Pillar:** STORY & CATEGORY - "Be different, not better"

Everyone tells you to pick:

Charge Ferrari prices (exclusive, premium).

or

Charge Ford prices (volume, accessible).

But there's a third option nobody talks about.

Tesla.

Not cheap. Not ultra-luxury.

Great form AND great function.

Innovation over status.

Quality at accessible-premium.

You don't have to choose between serving few at high-priced clients or many at low prices.

You can build a Tesla brand:
→ Premium quality
→ Accessible pricing
→ More reach without becoming commoditized

That's the kind of brand we help our clients build.

Remember you have options & creativity. 

Now is the best time to build what's right for you.

## POST 3 - SIMPLE SYSTEMS (Wednesday)
**Pillar:** SIMPLE SYSTEMS - "The boring funnel that works"

The $20K/month funnel is boring, but it's not complicated.

It's 4 things:

1. A free email course that teaches your best thinking
2. A "book a call" page at the end
3. A weekly newsletter to stay top of mind
4. A daily promotion engine

That's it.

No AI sales bots. No 47-step automations.

Get those 4 working first. Then add more: 

Outreach, content, ads.

Don't skip the basics.

Be boring.

## POST 5 - WILDCARD (Friday)
**Pillar:** Personal / Origin Story

I've been all over the place.
SEO, web design, copywriting, funnels, video production, and paid ads.

For years I thought that was a weakness. 

"Pick a lane, Marcio"

But here's what I've realized:

All of it was teaching me the skills I use today.

Helping experts go from implementing their playbooks.

To building and monetizing new playbooks.

The positioning. 

The story. The simple system that actually works.

Your winding path isn't a bug. It's your unfair advantage.

If you're the type of person that has tried it all, good.

The key is to find the thread that connects it all.

And here's a secret: you create the thread.

You are the storyteller of your life.

And you're writing it right now.

So make it good.
