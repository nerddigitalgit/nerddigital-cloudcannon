## MONDAY - FOCUS

The biggest lie in online business: "Do more."

One more course. One more funnel. One more strategy.

But here's what I've seen after helping experts hit $20K+ months:

The ones who win aren't doing more.

They're finishing what they already started.

Your half-built funnel is costing you more than no funnel at all.

What's the one thing you started but never finished?

## TUESDAY - STORY & CATEGORY

Most consultants position themselves wrong.

  They either:
  - Go generic and compete on price (Ford)
  - Or go ultra-exclusive like (Ferrari)

  There's a third way. Tesla positioning.

  Premium quality. Accessible pricing. Limited supply.

  Here's how to build it:

  1. Get specific about who you help

  ↳ Not "businesses." Not "leaders."
  ↳ One type of person with one type of problem.
  ↳ "I help ops consultants land $10K projects without cold outreach."

  2. Use results-based pricing

  ↳ 10% of the avg. value your clients generate in new revenue in 12 months.
  ↳ If they net $100k, your $10k fee is a no brainer.

  3. Continue to improve your product

  ↳ Keep improving your delivery: Faster, easier, better results for your clients.  
  ↳ The more they win, the more you win.

  4. Control your supply

  ↳ Increase your prices as you get better.
  ↳ And get selective about who you work with.

In a crowded market results speak louder than rebrands and hype.
  
And now is the best time to show your results.

## WEDNESDAY - SIMPLE SYSTEMS

The $20K/month funnel is boring, but it's not complicated.

It's 4 things:

1. A free email course that teaches your best thinking
2. A "book a call" page at the end
3. A weekly newsletter to stay top of mind
4. A daily promotion engine

That's it.

No AI sales bots. No 47-step automations.

Get those 4 working first. Then add more:

Outreach, content, ads.

Don't skip the basics.

Be boring.

## FRIDAY - PERSONAL

I've been all over the place.

SEO, web design, copywriting, funnels, video production, and paid ads.

For years I thought that was a weakness.

"Pick a lane, Marcio"

But here's what I've realized:

All of it was teaching me the skills I use today.

Helping experts go from implementing their playbooks.

To building and monetizing new playbooks.

The positioning.

The story. The simple system that actually works.

Your winding path isn't a bug. It's your unfair advantage.

If you're the type of person that has tried it all, good.

The key is to find the thread that connects it all.

And here's a secret: you create the thread.

You are the storyteller of your life.

And you're writing it right now.

So make it good.

What's the thread connecting everything you've done?
