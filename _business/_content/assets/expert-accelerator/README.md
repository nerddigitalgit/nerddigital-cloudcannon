## Key Concepts

### The Three Skills (Playbook Framework)
1. **Learn the playbook** — Understand what actually works
2. **Apply the playbook** — Execute in your business
3. **Create your playbook** — Develop original approaches others will copy

### The Two Worlds
- **External world** — Market, competition, platforms (can't control)
- **Internal world** — Your systems, skills, execution (your only lever)

### The $20K Threshold
- $10K/month after taxes/benefits ≈ $85K salaried job
- $20K/month after taxes/benefits ≈ $165K+ salaried equivalent
- $20K is where going independent actually makes sense
