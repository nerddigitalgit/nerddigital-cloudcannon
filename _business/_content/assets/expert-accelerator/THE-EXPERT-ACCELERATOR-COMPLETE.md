# DAY 0: WELCOME EMAIL

**Subject:** Welcome to The Expert Accelerator
**Sub-text:** $10K to $80K per month

---

Hey there!

Thanks for joining The Expert Accelerator.

Over the next 5 days, you're going to learn the 5 marketing mistakes that keep experts stuck below $20K/month—and the exact frameworks to fix each one.

These are the same frameworks that helped coaches like Robbie grow from $10K to $80K in monthly recurring revenue.

Here's what's coming:

- **Day 1 - STOP:** The 5 marketing mistakes keeping you stuck (and what they're actually costing you)
- **Day 2 - START:** The Mini-Launch Method to test what works before you build
- **Day 3 - SPEED:** The Free Coaching Course Framework to become memorable and stand out
- **Day 4 - SELL:** Contextual Selling—how to pitch without being salesy
- **Day 5 - SCALE:** The Repackaging System to do more with what you've already built

Each day: 1 mistake or framework. 1 action step you can complete in under 10 minutes.

No fluff. No theory. Just practical systems you can implement immediately.

**Quick intro:**

My name is Marcio Santos. I run Nerd Digital, helping coaches, consultants, and experts market their businesses without getting stuck in the weeds of strategy, tech, and content.

We've helped clients generate over $3 million in sales.

I'm not going to pretend I was born a marketing genius. I struggled through video game addiction, depression, and being completely broke after leaving my full-time job. I know how hard it is to grow a business when you're doing everything yourself.

If I can figure this out, so can you.

# DAY 1: STOP

**Subject:** The 5 Marketing Mistakes (and what they cost you)
**Sub-Text:** Why experts stay stuck below $20K/month

---

Hey there!

Welcome to Day 1 of The Expert Accelerator.

Today you're getting all 5 marketing mistakes that keep experts stuck below $20K/month.

Most don't know they're making them.

Let's fix that.

---

## Why This Matters Right Now

It's harder than ever to grow an expert business.

5.1 million new businesses registered last year. Your ideal client sees dozens of coaches and consultants saying similar things. AI-generated content floods every platform.

**There are two worlds you can try to influence:**

The **external world**: the market, the competition, the platforms, the algorithms. It's getting harder every day. You can't control it.

Then there's the **internal world**: your systems, your skills, your execution. That's the only lever you have.

The experts who are growing? They're not fighting the external world harder. They're mastering the internal one.

---

**Why $20K/month?**

You'll hear me use $20K/month as the threshold throughout this course. Here's why:

$10K/month sounds good—until you factor in self-employment taxes, health insurance, retirement, and the fact that you're doing everything yourself. After all that, $10K/month is roughly equivalent to an $85K salaried job. Fine, but not life-changing.

$20K/month ($240K/year) is different. After covering your own benefits and taxes, that's equivalent to a $165K+ salaried position—without a boss, without a ceiling, with full ownership of what you've built.

That's the threshold where going independent actually makes sense. That's what we're aiming for.

Here are the 5 mistakes keeping you below it.

## MISTAKE #1: SALES BEFORE TRUST

**What it is:** Asking people to book a $3K-$50K call before they know you can help them.

**Why experts make it:** They're using tactics designed for $5-$50 products—where nobody needs to trust you. But high-ticket services require proof first.

**What it costs you:**
- 30-50% no-show rates on booked calls
- Leads unsubscribe within 48 hours
- Inconsistent revenue ($15K one month, $3K the next)

## MISTAKE #2: GENERIC POSITIONING

**What it is:** Positioning yourself as a "business coach" or "marketing expert"—the same as 47 other people in your niche.

**Why experts make it:** Fear of niching down. They think specificity limits opportunity.

**What it costs you:**
- You compete on price (charging $500 when you should charge $5K)
- Prospects ask "So... what exactly do you do?" and you fumble
- You attract bargain-hunters who negotiate you down

## MISTAKE #3: FORGETTABLE LEAD MAGNETS

**What it is:** Giving away simple one-page PDFs or checklists that look exactly like everyone else's.

**Why experts make it:** Following "simple lead magnet" templates instead of overdelivering value.

**What it costs you:**
- Leads download and forget you exist in 48 hours
- 8-12% email open rates (vs 40%+ for memorable experts)
- Empty pipeline—you're always chasing new leads

## MISTAKE #4: BUYERS ONLY MARKETING

**What it is:** Only marketing to people ready to buy TODAY.

Think of it like this: You're sitting at the dock fishing for the few fish swimming by. Meanwhile, 97% of the fish are out in open water—and your competitors are building boats to reach them.

**Why experts make it:** They think helping people who aren't ready to buy is a "waste of time."

**What it costs you:**
- Tiny pool of prospects (a few hundred vs thousands)
- Competitors build relationships with future buyers months in advance
- Cost per acquisition is 10x higher

## MISTAKE #5: GUESSING INSTEAD OF TESTING

**What it is:** Building marketing assets (lead magnets, courses, offers) based on hunches instead of testing with real people.

**Why experts make it:** They think "I'm an expert, I know what people need."

**What it costs you:**
- 3 weeks building a lead magnet → 12 downloads → zero sales
- Pivoting strategies every 30 days because nothing works
- Stuck at $3K-$15K/month for years

## THE GOOD NEWS

These mistakes aren't permanent.

You can fix them. Systematically.

Over the next 4 days, I'm giving you the exact frameworks to fix them:

- **Day 2 - START:** The Mini-Launch Method (test before you build)
- **Day 3 - SPEED:** The Free Coaching Course Framework (become memorable)
- **Day 4 - SELL:** Contextual Selling (pitch naturally inside your education)
- **Day 5 - SCALE:** The Repackaging System (do more with what you've built)

## TOMORROW: DAY 2 - START

I'm going to show you how to use the Mini-Launch Method to test what actually gets attention—instead of guessing and spinning your wheels for weeks.

Talk soon,
Marcio

# DAY 2: START

**Subject:** START: Test First, Build Second
**Sub-Text:** The Mini-Launch Method

---

Hey there!

Welcome to Day 2 of The Expert Accelerator.

Yesterday, you learned the 5 mistakes keeping experts stuck.

Today, you'll learn how to fix the **Guessing Instead of Testing Mistake**.

Because here's the truth: Guessing is expensive.

Testing is how you move fast with less risk.

Let's dive in.

---

## THE ATTENTION PROBLEM

Before anyone buys from you, they have to NOTICE you.

And that's harder than ever because:

- 5.1 million new businesses registered in 2024
- The average person consumes 34GB of content daily
- Your ideal client sees 47 other experts saying similar things

So the first hurdle isn't selling.

It's breaking through the noise.

**And you can't guess your way through noise.**

---

## START: THE MINI-LAUNCH METHOD

Here's how growing experts do it differently:

They don't brainstorm ideas and pick the one that "feels right."

They TEST small, fast, and cheap—and let real strangers tell them what actually gets attention.

**The shift:**

- **Old way:** Idea → Build → Launch → Hope → Start over when it flops
- **New way:** Idea → Test → Build only what's proven → Launch with confidence

This is the Mini-Launch Method.

---

## HOW IT WORKS (3 STEPS)

**Step 1: Isolate One Variable**

Don't test your entire offer. Test ONE thing at a time.

Examples:
- Pain points: "Which problem gets the most clicks?"
- Outcomes: "Which result do people want most?"
- Offer names: "Which title sounds most valuable?"

**Step 2: Create a Simple Test**

You don't need a fancy landing page or expensive ads.

Just create a simple mockup and see if anyone clicks.

**Example - Testing Pain Points:**

Create 5 simple images with different pain statements:

- "Stuck at $10K/month despite working 60 hours/week?"
- "Leads download your stuff and ghost you 48 hours later?"
- "Can't charge premium prices because you're seen as 'generic'?"

Post them organically on LinkedIn. See which gets the most engagement.
Better yet, run a traffic campaign using Meta Ads to validate your pain statements in 24 hours.

**Step 3: Build What's Proven**

Now that you KNOW which pain point gets attention, build your marketing around it.

You just saved yourself weeks of guessing wrong.

---

## REAL EXAMPLE: HOW WE TESTED THIS COURSE

Before creating this email course, we tested it with $74.45 in Meta Ads over 5 days:

- 15,282 people saw our tests
- 190 clicked (1.24% CTR)
- We tested 12 different headlines, 9 names, 5 images

Result: We found a winning combination that proved people wanted this course BEFORE we spent weeks writing it.

That's the Mini-Launch Method.

Test small. Build only what's proven.

---

## WHY THIS WORKS

When you test with real strangers, two things happen:

**1. You stop wasting time.**

No more building lead magnets nobody downloads. No more offers that flop. You know what works before you build it.

**2. You actually solve real problems.**

Testing forces you to understand what your audience actually wants—not what you THINK they want.

And when you solve real problems, people pay attention.

# DAY 3: SPEED

**Subject:** SPEED: Slow Down to Speed Up
**Sub-Text:** The Free Coaching Course Framework

---

Hey there!

Welcome to Day 3 of The Expert Accelerator.

Today's lesson sounds backwards:

**You speed up by slowing down.**

Let me explain.

---

## THE SPEED PARADOX

Most experts try to speed up sales by:

- Pitching faster
- Following up harder
- Adding more urgency

But here's what actually speeds up sales:

**Slowing down to educate first.**

Why?

Because when you overdeliver on free education, three things happen:

1. **You prove you know what you're talking about** — People see your expertise in action
2. **You stand out from everyone else** — While competitors give away one-page PDFs, you give real value
3. **You become memorable** — Instead of forgetting you in 48 hours, they look forward to your next email

And when you're the expert people remember and trust? Sales happen faster.

---

## SPEED: THE FREE COACHING COURSE FRAMEWORK

Here's the fix for Mistake #3 (Forgettable Lead Magnets):

Stop giving away simple one-page PDFs.

Start giving away Free Coaching Courses (FCC).

---

## WHY FCCS WORK

A Free Coaching Course makes you memorable because it:

✅ **Demonstrates expertise** — You teach them something valuable over multiple days

✅ **Creates anticipation** — They look forward to tomorrow's email

✅ **Builds familiarity** — By day 5, they feel like they know you

✅ **Delivers real results** — Unlike PDFs that get filed away and forgotten

Result: You become the expert people remember, recommend, and want to work with.

---

## WHAT AN FCC LOOKS LIKE

**Instead of:**

"5 Tips to Grow Your Business" (one-page PDF)

**Create:**

"The Revenue Roadblock: The 5 Hidden Mistakes Keeping Agencies Under $100K (And the Exact Frameworks to Fix Each One)"

- 5 emails over 5 days
- Each email: 1 mistake + 1 framework + 1 action step
- Soft CTAs throughout: "Reply 'framework' for the bonus cheat sheet"

---

## THE DIFFERENCE THIS MAKES

**Forgettable Expert:**

- Lead magnet: One-page PDF
- Email 1: "Here's your PDF!"
- Email 2: "Ready to book a call?"
- Result: 8% open rates, zero replies, "Who sent this?"

**Memorable Expert:**

- Lead magnet: 5-day FCC
- Email 1-5: Deep value on each mistake/framework
- Soft CTAs: "Reply 'help' if you want me to look at this with you"
- Result: 40%+ open rates, replies every day, "I've been waiting for this email"

The memorable expert stands out by overdelivering.

---

## REAL EXAMPLE: ROBBIE CRABTREE

Communication coach. Massive LinkedIn audience. Stuck at $10K-$20K monthly revenue.

We added a Free Coaching Course to his funnel.

90 days later: $80K in monthly recurring revenue.

What changed?

He stopped trying to speed up sales with urgency.

He slowed down to educate systematically.

And sales accelerated.

---

## ⏱ 10-MINUTE ACTION STEP

Outline your first FCC:

1. What's ONE problem your ideal customer has that—when solved—makes them more likely to buy your core offer?

2. List 5 steps you use to solve that problem.

3. For each step, write:
   - Why people struggle with it
   - The negative outcome of not fixing it
   - A soft CTA: "Reply 'X' for my [framework name]"

Congratulations. You just outlined your Free Coaching Course.

Now you can speed up by slowing down.

# DAY 4: SELL

**Subject:** SELL: Pitch in Context (Not Cold)
**Sub-Text:** How to sell without being salesy

---

Hey there!

Welcome to Day 4 of The Expert Accelerator.

If you've been following along, you now have:

✅ A tested pain point that gets attention (Day 2)

✅ A Free Coaching Course that makes you memorable (Day 3)

Now it's time to SELL.

But not with a cold pitch. With a contextual offer.

Let me show you.

---

## THE PROBLEM WITH MOST PITCHES

Most experts pitch like this:

Day 1-5: Give free value

Day 6: "Ready to work together? Book a call!"

The problem? That pitch is OUT OF CONTEXT.

You just taught them about lead magnets... and now you're pitching a $5K coaching program?

The jump is too big. So they ghost.

---

## SELL: CONTEXTUAL SELLING

Here's how it works:

You pitch INSIDE each lesson—in the context of the problem you just solved.

**The pattern:**

1. **Problem identified** — "Here's the mistake you're making"
2. **Problem explained** — "Here's why it's costing you"
3. **Problem solved** — "Here's the framework to fix it"
4. **Offer to help deeper** — "Want me to help you implement this? Reply 'help'"

The pitch feels NATURAL because it's directly connected to what you just taught.

---

## EXAMPLE: SELLING INSIDE YOUR FCC

Let's say you're a sales coach teaching a Free Coaching Course on "The 5 Sales Mistakes Killing Your Close Rate."

**Email 3: Mistake #3 - Weak Discovery Questions**

[You teach them about weak discovery, give them better questions, show examples]

Then at the end:

*"If you want to workshop your discovery questions with me 1:1, reply 'discovery' and I'll send you a link to book a free 20-minute call where we'll audit your current questions and I'll give you 3 you can use immediately."*

That's not salesy. That's helpful.

And some people will say yes—because you just helped them identify a real problem and showed them how to fix it.

Now they want deeper help.

---

## THE 3 TYPES OF CONTEXTUAL OFFERS

You can pitch 3 things inside your FCC:

**Type 1: Free Implementation Call**

"Reply 'audit' for a free 20-min call to apply this framework to your business"

**Type 2: Paid Workshop**

"I'm running a 90-min live workshop next week where we'll implement all 5 frameworks together. $97. Reply 'workshop' for details."

**Type 3: Core Coaching Offer**

"If you want help implementing this across your entire funnel, I have 2 spots open for 1:1 coaching. Reply 'coaching' and I'll send details."

Each offer is IN CONTEXT of what you just taught.

So it doesn't feel like a pitch. It feels like the natural next step.

---

## WHY CONTEXTUAL SELLING WORKS

Two reasons:

**1. The timing is right.**

You just solved a problem for them. They're thinking about that problem RIGHT NOW. Offering more help in that moment makes sense.

**2. You've already proven you can help.**

They didn't just read a pitch. They experienced your expertise. Now the question shifts from "Can this person help me?" to "Do I want MORE help?"

That's a much easier sale.

---

## ⏱ 10-MINUTE ACTION STEP

Go back to your FCC outline from yesterday.

For each of the 5 lessons, write:

1. The problem you're solving in that lesson
2. One contextual offer you can make at the end
3. The exact CTA: "Reply '[word]' for [specific help]"

Now your FCC doesn't just educate—it generates sales opportunities.

---

# DAY 5: SCALE

**Subject:** SCALE: The Repackaging System
**Sub-Text:** Do more with what you've built

---

Hey there!

Welcome to Day 5 of The Expert Accelerator—the final lesson.

You now have:

✅ A tested pain point (Day 2)

✅ A Free Coaching Course that makes you memorable (Day 3)

✅ Contextual offers that sell (Day 4)

Now it's time to SCALE.

And scaling doesn't mean "build more stuff."

It means: **Do more with what you've already built.**

Let me show you.

---

## THE REPACKAGING PHILOSOPHY

Here's what most experts do:

They build a lead magnet... get some leads... then think "I need a NEW lead magnet to grow more."

So they start over. New topic. New frameworks. New content.

**That's exhausting. And unnecessary.**

Here's what growing experts do instead:

They master the art of REPACKAGING.

Same foundation. Same frameworks. Different packaging.

---

## SCALE: THE REPACKAGING SYSTEM

Your Free Coaching Course is your foundation.

Everything you create from now on is just a repackaging of that foundation into different formats.

---

## THE 5 WAYS TO REPACKAGE

**1. Repackage Time (Group Events)**

Turn your FCC into a live workshop:

- 5-day course → 90-minute live workshop
- Same frameworks, taught live with Q&A
- Charge $47-$197

**2. Repackage Proximity (1:1 Calls)**

Turn your FCC into a 1:1 intensive:

- 5-day course → 90-minute 1:1 implementation call
- Walk them through applying all 5 frameworks to THEIR business
- Charge $497-$997

**3. Repackage Format (Content)**

Turn your FCC into social content:

- Email 1 → LinkedIn carousel
- Email 2 → YouTube video
- Email 3 → Twitter thread
- Same teaching, different platforms

**4. Repackage Depth (Paid Course)**

Turn your FCC into a paid mini-course:

- 5 emails → 5 video lessons with worksheets
- Same content, more depth and implementation
- Charge $297-$997

**5. Repackage Trends (New Mechanisms)**

Turn your FCC into whatever's trending:

- Skool community with your 5 frameworks as modules
- Weekly office hours where you teach one framework per week
- AI workshop on "How to use ChatGPT to implement these 5 frameworks"

**Same foundation. Different packaging.**

---

## THE UNSUBSCRIBE OR BUY PHILOSOPHY

Here's how growing experts think about their email list:

**Everyone on your list will eventually do one of two things: unsubscribe or buy.**

Your job isn't to "protect" your list by emailing less.

Your job is to:

- Send more emails teaching your frameworks
- Make more contextual offers
- Repackage your foundation into more formats
- Give people more chances to work with you

The people who aren't a fit will unsubscribe. That's good.

The people who ARE a fit will buy. That's even better.

---

## REAL EXAMPLE: HOW WE SCALE

This course you just finished?

Here's how we're repackaging it:

1. **Live workshop** — "The Expert Accelerator" (90-min, $97)
2. **LinkedIn content** — Each mistake becomes a carousel
3. **YouTube series** — 5 videos, one per mistake
4. **Paid mini-course** — Video version with worksheets ($297)
5. **1:1 intensive** — "Marketing Audit" ($997)

Same foundation. 5 different packages.

---

## ⏱ 10-MINUTE ACTION STEP

Pick ONE repackaging method to implement this week:

1. Look at your FCC outline from Day 3
2. Choose one repackaging format from the list above
3. Schedule 30 minutes this week to create it
4. Launch it to your list with a contextual offer

That's how you scale. Not by building more. By doing more with what you've built.

---

## YOU MADE IT

Congratulations. You just completed The Expert Accelerator.

You now have:

✅ The 5 mistakes to STOP making

✅ The Mini-Launch Method to START with data

✅ The FCC Framework to SPEED up (by slowing down)

✅ Contextual Selling to SELL naturally

✅ The Repackaging System to SCALE

You have everything you need to break past $20K/month.

Now you just have to implement it.

---

## THE GAP IS REAL

Here's the truth:

There's a gap between experts who grow and experts who stay stuck.

The ones who grow aren't smarter. They aren't more talented.

They just stopped making the 5 mistakes that keep everyone else stuck.

You now know what those mistakes are.

And you have the frameworks to fix them.

---

## WHAT COMES NEXT

Remember the three skills I mentioned in the welcome email?

1. **Learn the playbook** — You just did this. You learned the 5 mistakes and 4 frameworks.
2. **Apply the playbook** — This is your next step. Implement what you learned.
3. **Create your playbook** — This is where it gets exciting.

Once you've mastered applying proven plays, something shifts.

You stop following. You start leading.

You develop your own frameworks. Your own methods. Your own language.

And that's when you earn outsized returns on your expertise—because now YOU'RE the one others are studying.

But you can't skip steps 1 and 2.

Master the fundamentals first. Apply the playbook until it's automatic. Then—and only then—start creating your own.

The question is: Will you implement?
