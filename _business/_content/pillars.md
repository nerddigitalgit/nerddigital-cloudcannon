# Content Pillars

The 4 core topics you create content around. Every post fits one of these. If it doesn't fit, it's a note - not content.

**Avatar:** Coaches, consultants, course creators stuck below $20K/month who are good at what they do but can't grow past their revenue ceiling.

## Pillar 1: FOCUS
*"Finish before you chase"*

**Theme:** Stop shiny object syndrome. Nail the fundamentals before adding volume. Simple beats complex.

**Why it matters to ideal client:** They keep jumping to the next tactic, course, or strategy before finishing what they started. They're busy but not progressing.

**Example topics:**
- Why your half-finished funnel is costing you more than no funnel
- The only 3 things you need before "adding gas"
- Stop optimizing what isn't working yet
- Your marketing isn't broken, it's unfinished
- Fundamentals before volume (always)
- The problem with "I'll just try this one thing"

## Pillar 2: STORY & CATEGORY
*"Be different, not better"*

**Theme:** Narrative intelligence + category design. The stories you tell (and believe) shape everything. Stop competing - create your own lane.

**Why it matters to ideal client:** They sound like everyone else. They struggle to explain what they do. Marketing feels gross because they're trying to "sell themselves" instead of telling a story.

**Example topics:**
- Why you can't explain what you do (and how to fix it)
- The story you're telling yourself that's keeping you stuck
- Category of one: stop competing, start leading
- You don't have a marketing problem, you have a narrative problem
- How to talk about your work without cringing
- Why "what do you do?" is a trap (and what to say instead)
- Your positioning isn't a tagline, it's a story

**Frameworks to reference:** Michael Margolis (narrative intelligence), Category Pirates, Nicolas Cole

## Pillar 3: SIMPLE SYSTEMS
*"The boring funnel that works"*

**Theme:** Email course → Book a call → Weekly newsletter → Then add gas. Stop overcomplicating. Most experts need fewer moving parts, not more.

**Why it matters to ideal client:** They're overwhelmed by all the tactics. They think they need complex funnels, webinars with filters, automated sequences. They don't. They need the basics, done consistently.

**Example topics:**
- The 3-step funnel that gets you to $20K/month
- Why your webinar funnel is too complicated
- Email course → Calls → Newsletter (that's it)
- Stop filtering leads, start having conversations
- The "add gas" framework: outreach, content, ads (in that order)
- You don't need more leads, you need to follow up
- The weekly newsletter that keeps you top of mind

---

## Pillar 4: TEST EVERYTHING
*"Stop guessing, start knowing"*

**Theme:** Rapid testing with low budgets. Validate before you build. Data over gut feelings. Use Meta ads to test messaging fast.

**Why it matters to ideal client:** They build offers, courses, and content based on assumptions. They spend months on something nobody wants. Testing feels expensive or complicated - but it doesn't have to be.

**Example topics:**
- How to test your offer for $50 before building it
- The rapid testing method I use for every client
- Why your gut feeling about your audience is probably wrong
- Test the headline before you write the course
- $5/day tests that tell you exactly what to say
- Stop building, start validating
- The message test that saves you 3 months of wasted work

## Content Rules

1. **Every post fits a pillar.** No exceptions.
2. **Speak to one avatar.** Coaches/consultants below $20K/month.
3. **One idea per post.** Don't stack concepts.
4. **End with tension or action.** Don't just inform - make them think or move.
5. **Done > Perfect.** Ship it.
