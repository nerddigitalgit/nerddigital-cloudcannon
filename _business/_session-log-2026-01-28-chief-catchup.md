## What We Accomplished

### SEO Proposal - Baby Skincare E-Commerce
- Drafted and sent proposal with two packages:
  - **Option A:** Full SEO Foundation + Content Strategy - $2,400
  - **Option B:** SEO Foundation Only - $1,700
- Anchored against original $1,900 audit quote
- Added Friday deadline bonus (free email course outline)
- Timeline: 4-6 weeks
- Discussed Shopify SEO limitations (URL structure locked, no server access, theme-dependent headings, but can optimize metadata/content/structure)

---

## Key Decisions Made

- **SEO proposal sent** - Waiting on response. Framed as discount from original quote, implementation included, no design changes.
- **Shopify constraints acknowledged** - Implementation is metadata/content/structure work, not deep code rewrites. Positioned as a feature (not touching her design).

---

## TODO for Next Session

- [ ] Follow up on SEO proposal if no response
- [ ] Finish social content for NerdDigital
- [ ] Website rebuild with new design system
- [ ] Expert Conversion Code emails (Days 3, 4, 5) - review and tighten

---

## Notes

- Umair's costs: $995 (audit + implementation, 4-6 weeks) + $395 (keyword research + content strategy) = $1,390 total
- Your margin: $705-1,010 (41-42%)
- Sylver Consulting still warm - may need follow-up after mockup
