description: End session and create a log for next time
---

We're wrapping up this session. Create a session log so we can pick up where we left off next time.

Ask me:
1. "What should we call this session?" (short topic name for the filename, e.g., "email-course" or "linkedin-content")
2. "Anything specific you want me to capture for next time?"

Then create a new file at `_business/_session-log-YYYY-MM-DD-{topic}.md` using today's date and the topic name.

The log should include:
- **Session date and topic** (as the title)
- **What We Accomplished** - bullet points of what got done
- **Key Decisions Made** - any important choices or directions locked in
- **TODO for Next Session** - checklist of what's left to do
- **Notes** - any context that would help pick this back up

Keep it concise. This is a handoff document, not a transcript.

After creating the file, confirm the filename and say: "Session logged. See you next time."
