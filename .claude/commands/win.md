I'll help you log a client win.

Ask me:
1. Client name (or type if anonymous)?
2. Which offer did they purchase?
3. What was the result/outcome?
4. Any metrics or numbers?
5. Do you have a quote from them?
6. What made this engagement work?

Then append a new entry to _business/_intel/wins.md using the template format.
