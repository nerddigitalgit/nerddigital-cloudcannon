description: Draft a client proposal
args: client_name
---

Read the following files for context:
- _business/_offers/offer-stack.md
- _business/_offers/pricing.md
- _business/_legal/scope-template.md
- _business/_legal/contract-template.md
- _business/_identity/ideal-client.md

If a meeting note exists for this client, also read:
- _business/_intel/meeting-notes/*$ARGUMENTS*.md

You are now drafting a proposal for: $ARGUMENTS

Ask me:
1. What problem are we solving for them?
2. Which offer(s) from the stack fit?
3. Any special circumstances or scope adjustments?

Then draft the proposal using the scope template structure.
